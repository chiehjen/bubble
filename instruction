R.f90 solves Rayleight-Plesset eq. using 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

To compile:

gfortran R.f90 -o R.x

To run:

1. Modify fort.10 and fort.99
2. ./R.x

----------------

  Define dR/dt=Z, then we solve 2nd order ODE by:
   dR/dt=Z
   dZ/dt=f . With f=-[1.5*Z^2+4v*Z/R+2*gamm/rho/R+DeltaP(t)/rho]/R .
 Here DeltaP(t) is given in functional form, all other constants: v, gamm, rho are known (value will be read in).
